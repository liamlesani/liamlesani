# Hey, I'm Liam 👋

With over seven years of experience in the field of SEO, I have developed expertise in working with a wide range of websites, from various small sites with just a few pages to a large-scale platform with over twenty million pages. I am always eager to learn and committed to continuous improvement. My approach is data-driven and results-oriented, combining advanced technical analysis with creative strategies to boost organic traffic. Currently, my focus is primarily on enterprise e-commerce websites, as I believe I can make the greatest impact in this area. That said, I am always excited to take on new challenges and explore fresh opportunities.
